                I will say that finding enough right people to join the organization has been a real challenge. 
                I partly believe that since there are no financial motivation, majority gets discouraged. 
                I am hoping that, there will be a time where things will be better. 
                Another current challenge is at the deployment stage. 
                There are few free online hosts and most are very limited in processing capacity and as a results limits our output.
                There are also instances where there are no computing devices available to deploy the software. We once visited a 
                school in a community in Ghana. We wanted to deploy an application which helps stage one students to learn
                how to count numbers, because there were no computers available in the school. We were not able to achieve our target.
